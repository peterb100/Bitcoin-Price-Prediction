# Regardless, the price of Bitcoin is a topic discussed from an economic angle, computer science, financial, and psychological perspective. 
The purpose of this project is to make a strong analyze on some of the main factors tha can influence the financial markets, respectively cryptocurrency market.

# The project is moving arround long term investments. I made a broader analysis of the market evolution in the recent years focusing on exchange, macroeconomics and sentiment analysis. Having this analysis in the frame, we can have a better point of view on project expectations and results. It is important tot see the problem from multiple perspectives.

# The projects is built using historical data for BTC, DowJones, S&P500, and NASDAQ. The decison to take these indices along with BTC data comes with the fact that these indices are directly influenced by macroeconomical factors or important announcements and their evolution has a storng impact on the crypto market. I also decided to calculate and add data for some technical indicators like moving averages, MACD or RSI.
The data is trained on multiple algorithms, from classical algorithms to the advanced ones.

# As a conclusion, contrary to some public opinions, BTC is influenced by many factors, including human emotions on certain periods of time like economical crises. Predicting a price-related variable is difficult given the multitude of forces impacting the market. Add to that the fact that the prices are by a large extent depended on future prospect rather than historical data.

# For better results, we can incapsulate more valuable data which might influence BTC price and do some hyperparameter tunning. These steps can get us to more accurate results, but we can never predict exactly what would be the price at the end of a certain day. Having this in mind, building a BTC price prediction project is very useful for long term investments, but can be very tricky for short term investments.
